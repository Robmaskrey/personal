      <h1>Rob Maskrey</h1>
      <p>I lived in Maine.</p>
      <p>I now live in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>I used to build a lot of things for a living.</p>
      <p>I read comic books and maintain a pretty big collection.</p>
      <p>I watch a lot movies and run a weekly movie night</a>.</p>
      <p>I have a beautiful <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/elimez" target="_blank">wife</a>, a pair of excitable cats, and I live above a backpacking store on the Appalacian Trail.</p>
      <p>I write <a href = "https://github.com/Robmaskrey" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href = "http://www.twitter.com/ianenders" target="_blank">idiotic comments</a> about the things I see.</p>
      <p>I sometimes write <a href = "http://blog.ianenders.com">longer idiotic comments</a> too.</p>
      <p>I was a creative asset for a lot of people around the country</p>
      <p>I am not anymore, but they're still cool.</p>
      <p>I am working with some awesome people right now building a network of interesting web applications.</p>
      <p>I am the CEO of <a href = "url placeholder">CodingHat Studios</a>, and we recently joined the <a href="placeholder url">Keystone Innovation Initiaive</a> family.</p>
      <p>I will not take on a project that doesn't make me happy or whole.</p>
      <p>I have a more detailed <a href="/resume.html">résumé</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
